Backup, backup and backup

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Easier to find bugs and reuse code

git diff //the files(id) to compare
git log //q for quitting

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

files can be interrelated

git clone

git config --global color.ui auto //color changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? compage changes between commits

git checkout
